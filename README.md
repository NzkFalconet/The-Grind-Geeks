# The-Grind-Geeks
We have developed a platform for developers worldwide to ask questions and share their knowledge by providing answers on the site. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB and Mongoose are utilized for the database.
